            <p>In today's digital age, cybersecurity has become increasingly important as more and more sensitive information is stored online and as cyber attacks become more sophisticated. 
            It is critical for individuals, businesses, and governments to take proactive steps to protect their digital assets and prevent cyber attacks.</p>

            <h4 class="title-sm mt-4">Before you start</h4>
            <p>Before delving into the world of cybersecurity, it's essential to understand that it's not a game. It's not just about using fancy tools to hack into systems or get access to sensitive information. 
            It's about protecting digital assets and preventing malicious attacks.</p>
            <p>If you're new to information security, forget everything you know about hacking. Don't start using tools without reading about pen testing and how it works. Don't download or use tools if you haven't audited their code. 
            Don't use these tools to do stupid things without consent on your friends or worst, your recruiter. 
            Read books, manuals, articles, be curious, and not just a script kiddie. And, most importantly, practice using challenges, not real targets!</p>

            <h4 class="title-sm mt-4">What is cybersecurity?</h4>
            <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and digital data from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or other malicious attacks. It involves a wide range of techniques and strategies designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.
               The field of cybersecurity encompasses a broad range of areas, including network security, application security, data security, cloud security, mobile security, and more. Some of the most common cybersecurity measures include firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and vulnerability assessments.
               Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important as more and more sensitive information is stored online and as cyber attacks become more sophisticated. It is critical for individuals, businesses, and governments to take proactive steps to protect their digital assets and prevent cyber attacks.
