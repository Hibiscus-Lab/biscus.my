               <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and digital data from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or other malicious attacks. It involves a wide range of techniques and strategies designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.

The field of cybersecurity encompasses a broad range of areas, including network security, application security, data security, cloud security, mobile security, and more. Some of the most common cybersecurity measures include firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and vulnerability assessments.

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important as more and more sensitive information is stored online and as cyber attacks become more sophisticated. It is critical for individuals, businesses, and governments to take proactive steps to protect their digital assets and prevent cyber attacks.</p>
